        "\n",
        "#### Goal: Analyze how loyalty program participation impacts dealership performance and customer behavior. The objective is to identify whether dealerships with higher loyalty card usage show stronger retention, higher average gross revenue, and more consistent service activity compared to those with lower adoption rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Use Cases:\n",
        "- Loyalty Impact by Dealer: Compare dealerships to see which locations benefit most from loyalty card usage (e.g., higher repeat visits, higher average cost per service).\n",
        "- Customer Segmentation by Loyalty: Cluster customers into groups such as “loyalty-driven repeat clients,” “occasional users,” and “non-loyalty walk-ins,” and compare their service patterns across dealerships.\n",
        "- Dealer benchmarking: Evaluate whether dealerships with high loyalty participation also outperform in revenue, retention, and service frequency compared to those with low participation\n",
        "- Distance Insights: Explore if loyalty members are more willing to travel longer distances to specific dealerships\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outcome:\n",
        "- Clusters of dealerships grouped by loyalty adoption and performance.\n",
        "- Customer segments showing different loyalty-driven behaviors.\n",
        "- A performance dashboard that highlights which dealerships use loyalty effectively and which may need support.\n",
        "- Actionable recommendations for leadership on how to leverage the loyalty program to improve dealer performance, customer retention, and revenue.\n"
